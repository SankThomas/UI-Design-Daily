# UI-Design-Daily

Featuring UI Design Daily's UI components translated into code

## Main repository and where to find the UI Components

The UI components can be found on uidesigndaily.com. They provide weekly UI components, and I will be choosing one component at a time and translate it into code, then upload it to GitHub at https://github.com/SankThomas/ui-design-daily as the main repository.

## Few things to note

The UIs are just to provide 'inspiration' so to say. Most things like colors will come from the UI itself, but I will also be adding other things like animations and images, links, svgs, which I don't currently have access to. And of course, JavaScript.

## Homepage

Also, the homepage for the website is a bit trash, but as components begin to fill the space, I will get the structure and adjust it's look and feel.

### Updates

Check back again for regular updates because I will try to do a component a day for a month or two. The first one I've done today, 9th October 2020, and it is called 'Modal'. I've added this in for accountability.
